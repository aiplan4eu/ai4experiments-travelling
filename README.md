# ai4experiments-travelling
This repository contains the code that integrates the up-graphene-engine and the travelling problem (navigating a graph) to create a component in the ai4experiments platform.

The aiplan4eu-travelling component and the aiplan4eu-travel solution are generated from this repo.
